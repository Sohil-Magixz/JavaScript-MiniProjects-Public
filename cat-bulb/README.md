# Cat and Bulb

This is a simple web project that demonstrates toggling between two different visual states using JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. The project shows an image of a cat and a bulb that changes based on user interaction.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main states:

1. **On State**: Displays an image of a bulb turned on and a cat.
2. **Off State**: Displays an image of a bulb turned off and a cat's eyes glowing in the dark.

Users can switch between these states using two buttons, "On" and "Off".

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup language used to create the structure of the web page.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: A utility-first CSS framework to style the web page elements.
- **JavaScript**: Used to add interactive functionality to the buttons.
